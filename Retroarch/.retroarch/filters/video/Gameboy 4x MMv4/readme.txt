These filters are intended for GB and GBC roms on a Miyoo Mini v4.

The Crop filters will scale the video 4x and also crop 4 pixels from the top or bottom depending on which file is used. 

The Crunch filters will compress a few pixels at the very edges so as not to crop them.

Select the best filter for each game so that important pixels are not clipped from the display.

'GB_4x_Crop0_MMv4'  will crop 4 pixels off the top
'GB_4x_Crop2_MMv4'  will crop 2 pixels off both the top and bottom
'GB_4x_Crop4_MMv4'  will crop 4 pixels off the bottom
'GB_4x_Crunch0_MMv4' will crop a single pixel and compress 6 pixels on the top while compressing 2 pixels on the bottom
'GB_4x_Crunch1_MMv4' will compress 6 pixels on the top and bottom while cropping no pixels

These may be used with the 'gb_grid_4x_mmv4' overlays.
