# Miyoo Mini v4 Scaling Filters Overlays

These are filters and overlays for making certain systems display better on the 752x560 resolution if the Miyoo Mini v4.

Integer Scaling:

GBA Perfect 3x - Offset

Wonderswan 3x - Offset

These are offset so that the left right and top bezels are equal width. Square pixel grid with optional bezels. Made possible by u/Sikalop 's custom offset filter, "Offset_up8px.filt", which needs to be enabled in the video menu of retroarch, found under custom offset. "Offset_down13px.filt" is used for some wonderswan overlays.

GB 4x - Crop or Crunch

Neo Geo Pocket 4x - Crop or Crunch

This is an overscale to achieve 4x integer scaling for these 1:1 handhelds. GB has a very slight 4px vertical crop, whereas the NGP has a more significant 12px. The crunch filters compress pixels near the edges of the screen rather than crop them. There are different grid styles that work with any of the filter files, so chose your preference â€” I like the cube overlay at 50% opacity. The Game Boy, Neo Geo Pocket, and Game Gear can all use the same overlays if displayed at the native resolution. The Game Gear, however, had non-square pixels and its games are intended to be displayed in 4:3. If displaying in 4:3, use the PicoDrive core and use the overlays in the picodrivegg folder. The filter file should be set as an override depending on each game to ensure that important pixels dont get cropped. 

MSX 3x - Crop

This is a  full screen 3x overscale with a very slight vertical and horizontal crop. To use this filter, the crop mode must be set to "MSX" in core options. Set the proper filter for each game so that important horizontal and vertical pixels dont get cropped. You can use the "MMv4" overlays, which are CRT frames + effects for the fullscreen MMv4 resolution

Misc Overscale 3x - Crop

These are filters designed to 3x overscale various resolutions which were used on home consoles and arcade systems. Significant screenspace is cropped, so these do not work well with all games. Many games however, particularly those with substantial HUDs, really benefit. Use 256x224 for most SNES, Genesis, or PC Engine games. 304x224 works for NEOGEO. 384x224 works for CPS2&3.

Non-Integer Scaled:

GB DMG, GB Color, NG Pocket, WS: Also included for these systems are full screen, proper aspect ratio, non integer scaled overlays. The overlays scale with the content resulting in a grid that is perfectly aligned with the pixels.

480p, MSX2: These are not perfectly scaled to the pixels, but for these its not too noticable. Different frame and opacity options available.

Overscale File Naming:

All the overscale filters have filenames that describe the filter followed by two digits. These two digits describe which part of the screen is displayed/cropped. As the first digit increases, the image will move from left to right. As the second digit increases the image will move from top to bottom. So, 00 will crop the most pixels on the left and top, while 44 would crop more pixels on the right and bottom.
